Understanting How Concsensus Algorithm Works
____________________________________________


At the time of writing this, the hash for a block on a popular blockchain needs to start with 19 zeros, and takes trillions of guesses to find a nonce that will produce a correct hash. So the race is started between miners the find a nonce (Number) that they can pass to the sha256 algorithm that can generate a hash the has 19 zeros at its start. So all the miners try to find that sha256 hash that starts with 19 zeros using there computational power (GPUS).
This is how the proof of work consensus method for adding blocks to a blockchain works. If you have a nonce that will produce the hash needed, it proves that you have spent computing power needed to find it. Because proof of work takes a lot of resources to find the nonce, the person that finds it is rewarded.
